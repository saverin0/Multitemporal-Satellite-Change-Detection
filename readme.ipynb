    "<p>The objective of this project is to detect and analyze land-cover or land-use changes over time using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. By comparing satellite images of the same geographic region taken at different time points, we aim to identify regions of significant change, such as urban expansion, deforestation, or flooding.\n",

    "Monitoring land-use and environmental changes over large areas is challenging and resource-intensive. Manual inspection of satellite images is inefficient, especially when dealing with multi-year archives.\n",
